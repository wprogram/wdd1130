    <p>
        Hello everyone! My name is God's Peace Etaje. I am a daughter, sister, aunt and a very loyal friend. Additionally, I am a singer. Music is my life. Music of all kinds makes me happy, whether I'm singing, listening, or dancing.</p> 
    <p>
        I am pursuing a degree in applied technology because I am passionate about the digital world we live in today. I would love to be a consumer and creator of applications we will use in this generation. It is my dream to become a "front-end and back-end creator." </p>
    <p>I am excited to get to know everyone in the class and to learn from and with everyone!</p>
