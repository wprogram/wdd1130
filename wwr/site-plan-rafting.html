      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This will be the official website for the white water rafting company, 'Water Away'. This website will inform customers what water rafting is about; it will include the company's vision and mission statements, and an introduction to the company's staff. Additionally, it will have pictures of the different rafters available and the packages (the price, the seating capacity, the duration of time, basically the 'Water Away Experience') they come with, how to pay for them and a virtual tour of the rafters. There will also be safety precautions associated with the rafters like weather conditions around the area and water currents, customer service and accessibility.</p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target customers are vacation companies. They can add our company to their vacation package because we will be stationed in a vacation area surrounded by hotels, Airbnb etc. This will help us directly reach out to people who want to have fun and try the rafting experience. They are likely to access the site using their device. The website will also be available for the public to access.</p>
